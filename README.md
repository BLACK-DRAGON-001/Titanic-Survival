# Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin information. The goal is to preprocess the data, train a classification model, and evaluate its performance.

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (e.g., imputing missing `Age`, filling `Embarked` values)
- Encode categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- Normalize numerical data (`Age`, `Fare`)
- Feature selection and engineering

## 🤖 Model Training
- Split dataset into training & testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split)
- Train multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Use hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

## 📈 Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC Curve

## 🚀 Installation & Usage
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
cd titanic-survival-prediction
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
